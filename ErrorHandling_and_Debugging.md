### Notes on Error Handling and Debugging in C++

Error handling and debugging are essential skills in programming to manage unexpected situations and identify issues in code. In C++, error handling is mainly done using `try-catch` blocks, and debugging involves various techniques to detect and resolve errors.

#### 1. **Error Handling with Try-Catch Blocks**

Error handling is the process of managing errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a program. In C++, the `try-catch` block is used to handle exceptions effectively. Here's a breakdown of how `try-catch` works:

- **`try` Block:** This block contains the code that might throw an exception. If an exception occurs, the control is transferred to the `catch` block.
- **`catch` Block:** This block catches the exception thrown by the `try` block. It contains the code to handle the exception.

##### **Real-Life Example: Bank Account Withdrawal**

Imagine a scenario where a bank customer wants to withdraw money from their account. We need to ensure that the withdrawal amount does not exceed the available balance. We can handle this using a `try-catch` block.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept> // For standard exceptions

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double balance = 5000.00; // Initial balance
    double withdrawal;

    cout << "Enter the amount to withdraw: ";
    cin >> withdrawal;

    try {
        if (withdrawal > balance) {
            throw overflow_error("Error: Insufficient balance."); // Throwing an exception
        }
        balance -= withdrawal;
        cout << "Withdrawal successful. Remaining balance: $" << balance << endl;
    }
    catch (const overflow_error& e) {
        cout << e.what() << endl; // Catching the exception
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The program checks if the withdrawal amount is greater than the available balance.
- If the withdrawal exceeds the balance, an `overflow_error` exception is thrown, which is then caught by the `catch` block, displaying an error message.

#### 2. **Common Debugging Techniques**

Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing bugs or errors in code. Here are some common debugging techniques:

- **Print Statements:**
  Insert print statements to track the flow of the program and the values of variables at different stages. This helps identify where the error occurs.

- **Use of a Debugger:**
  Utilize a debugger tool to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables. Debuggers are available in most Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.

- **Code Review:**
  Review your code or have a peer review it. This often helps spot logical errors or mistakes that might have been overlooked.

- **Divide and Conquer:**
  Isolate the part of the code causing the error by commenting out sections or writing test cases for smaller parts of the code.

##### **Real-Life Example: Debugging an Online Shopping Cart**

Imagine an online shopping cart system that adds the prices of items to calculate the total amount. A user reports that the total is incorrect. We can use print statements and breakpoints to debug this.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<double> prices = {19.99, 34.50, 7.25, 12.00}; // List of item prices
    double total = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
        total += prices[i]; // Accumulate total
        cout << "Debug: Adding price of item " << i + 1 << ": $" << prices[i] << endl; // Print statement for debugging
    }

    cout << "Total amount: $" << total << endl; // Print final total

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The print statement within the loop helps verify that each price is added correctly.
- If the total is incorrect, these statements can help identify if a specific itemâ€™s price is causing the error.

#### Conclusion

By using `try-catch` blocks, we can handle errors gracefully without crashing the program. Debugging techniques such as using print statements, a debugger, and code reviews help identify and resolve issues effectively, ensuring the program runs smoothly.
